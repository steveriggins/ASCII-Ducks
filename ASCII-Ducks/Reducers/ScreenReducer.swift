// This reducer takes an existing state of type AppState
// And checks to see what kind of action we'd like to operate on it
// If we got a ScreenActionNext, we ask the state's currentScreen what the next 
// screen should be (not sure if this is correct) and then updates it in a new copy
// of the state. We then return the state

// The current version of ReSwift declares the state parameter as an optional, so without
// reading the documentation, coded it to return a default AppState if no existing state was
// passed in, as the return type is required
